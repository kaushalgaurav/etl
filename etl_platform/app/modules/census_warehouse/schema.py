"""Canonical shape of the census warehouse tables.

Every census fetch, at any level, lands in the same three tables rather than
its own `ds_<id>`:

    census_raw     append-only, exactly what the connector returned
    census_clean   census_raw put through the standard cleaning operations
    census_master  one row per area — the deduped, final figures

The levels do not share a grain: a district row has no subdistrict, a
village/town row has four extra geography columns. Rather than a table per
level, the union of the geography columns is kept and the ones that do not
apply at a level are left NULL. `level` says which grain a row is at, and
`GRAIN` says which columns identify a row at that level.
