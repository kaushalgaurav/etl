"""Canonical shape of the HMIS warehouse tables.

Mirrors app/modules/census_warehouse: every HMIS report, at any level and
from any year, lands in the same three tables rather than its own `ds_<id>`.

    hmis_raw     append-only, one row per (area, indicator, metric year)
    hmis_clean   typed and standardised
    hmis_master  one row per area/indicator/period — the deduped figures

Unlike the census tables the grain here is long, not wide: the reports name
~200 indicators in prose and pair each with its previous year, so a wide
layout produces a new column per indicator per year (one F.1 year alone gave
1,257). Long form keeps the schema fixed however many years are loaded.
