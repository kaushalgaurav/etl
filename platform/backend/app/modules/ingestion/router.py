    Runs as a background job; returns a job id immediately. Poll
    `GET /jobs/{job_id}` until `status` is `succeeded`, then read the data with
    `GET /datasets/{dataset_id}/rows` or download `GET /datasets/{dataset_id}/export/csv`.

    For the Census of India API (`type=api`, url `https://censusindia.gov.in/nada/index.php/api/`)
    pick `level` = district | subdistrict | village_town | ward. Leave `state` empty
    for All India; the pull is split per state/district and saved as it goes.

    For HMIS Standard Reports (`type=api`, url `https://hmis.mohfw.gov.in/`) use `path`
    to name a folder in the Standard Reports tree. Leave `path` empty to crawl the whole
    tree: this returns a *planning* job that queues one child job per branch — grouped by
    `batch_by` = year | report_type | period — and succeeds as soon as the children are
    queued, so its own success means "work scheduled", not "data arrived". Watch the
    children in `GET /jobs`. Branches already ingested are skipped, so a later run picks
    up only new years; pass `refresh=true` to re-fetch them. `crawl=true` plans a named
    `path` the same way. Narrow a run with `file_pattern` (e.g. `ALL.xls` for just the
    combined report in each folder) and `max_files_per_chunk` for a trial.

    Note HMIS values are cumulative year-to-date — MonthUpToJune, UpToSeptember,
    UpToDecember, UpToMarch — so filter to one `period` when totalling; summing them
    counts the year several times over.
