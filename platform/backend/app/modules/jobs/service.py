"""Background job runner.

Ingesting a national dataset takes minutes (the Census pull is ~33 paginated
calls), so endpoints enqueue a Job and return its id immediately rather than
holding an HTTP connection open.

Execution uses a small thread pool — the work is I/O-bound (HTTP + SQLite),
and capping workers also avoids hammering government APIs with parallel
requests. Each job opens its own DB session; request-scoped sessions are gone
by the time a job runs.
