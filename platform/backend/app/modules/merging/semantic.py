"""SEMANTIC DATA LAYER: canonical field dictionary + column matching.

The hard part of this platform isn't downloading data — it's recognizing
that `District`, `district_name`, `Dist Name` and `DISTRICT_NM` all mean
the same thing so two datasets can actually be joined.

Matching runs in three tiers, most trustworthy first:
  1. exact alias hit in CANONICAL_FIELDS          -> confidence 1.0
  2. fuzzy match against a canonical name/alias   -> confidence = ratio
  3. direct fuzzy match between two raw column
     names, when neither maps to a canonical field -> capped confidence

Deliberately dependency-free (difflib, not rapidfuzz) and deterministic —
no LLM call is needed for the common cases. Claude can be layered on later
for the genuinely ambiguous ones.

The dictionary itself lives in app/constants/canonical_fields.py — extend it
there, no code changes needed here.
